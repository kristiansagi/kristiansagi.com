A year ago, I found myself standing in a doctor’s office, unprepared for the reality I was about to face.

“Please step on the scale,” the nurse said.
I hesitated. I hadn’t stepped on a scale in nearly two years, and I knew deep down I wasn’t going to like the result. My clothes had been mysteriously shrinking, and I had been avoiding the truth.
But there was no turning back now. I stepped onto the scale. The number that appeared was horrifying. I’d gained 20 kilograms in just two years. But what hit me hardest was the printout: My metabolic age was **67**.

## Sixty-seven.
My passport said I was 46. This wasn’t a science fiction plot — it was a wake-up call, a one-way ticket to self-destruction. I walked out of that office feeling disturbed, haunted by a single question: **How did I let this happen?**

## A Wake-Up Call

A week later, I was sitting in another doctor’s office, bracing for more bad news.

“Your cholesterol is through the roof,” my andrologist told me.
I had become the stereotype — a tech guy, overweight, sleep-deprived, living off convenience food, never finding time for checkups. It’s easy to ignore health problems when life is busy, but the reality was catching up fast.

Then came a lifeline. My doctor, Dr. Kristjan Pomm, recommended I see a specialist in men’s nutrition and weight management. I agreed, and looking back, it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

## Learning to Live (and Eat) Again

During one of my checkups, Dr. Kristel Ehala-Aleksejev looked at my results and said something that shook me to my core:

> **“If you continue like this, you may have ten years left. But if you make changes, you could have 40… maybe even 50 more years.”**

That moment terrified me. Health had always been something I’d push to deal with later, but suddenly, the numbers weren’t just numbers — they were my life. That was the motivation I needed to make drastic changes.

I realized that if I wanted to be there for my family, I had to take my health seriously. I’m not done yet, not ready to slow down. My family and I are still growing, and we want more children. To be present for them, I need to be healthy, energetic, and strong. I refuse to be someone already preparing for the second half of the “big game of life.” Not me. **Not yet.**

## My New Approach to Eating

+ Keep a detailed food journal — log everything, take pictures, and be honest.
+ Eat three times a day at consistent times — no skipping meals.
+ Add healthy snacks between meals.
+ Don’t count calories — focus on better food choices.
+ Minimize animal-based fats and white flour.
+ Eat more fiber, fish, and lean meats.
+ Incorporate fermented foods like pickles for gut health.
+ No alcohol. No sweets.

The results were shocking. In the first month alone, I lost nearly **8 kilograms**. Suddenly, things that once felt exhausting — stairs, long walks, even just standing for long periods — became easier. My XXL clothes were gathering dust as I reached for L. My energy surged, my sleep improved, and, to my surprise, so did my love life.

## The Truth About Alcohol

One of the most life-changing decisions I made was eliminating alcohol. Society normalizes drinking as a way to relax, socialize, or celebrate. But the truth is, alcohol is one of the most destructive substances we willingly consume.

### The hidden dangers of alcohol:

+ Sleep disruption: Even small amounts affect sleep quality and recovery.
+ Weight gain & metabolic damage: Alcohol slows metabolism, promotes fat storage, and increases cravings for unhealthy food.
+ Mental clarity & emotional stability: Regular drinking dulls focus, weakens motivation, and creates unnecessary stress.
+ Long-term health risks: Heart disease, liver failure, increased cancer risk, and early cognitive decline.
+ False relaxation: Alcohol masks stress temporarily but never fixes its root cause.

For me, the decision was simple: I want to be fully present for my family. I want to wake up every day with a clear mind, ready to tackle life’s challenges. I want to be active, engaged, and capable — not dulled, sluggish, or dependent on an artificial escape.

Without alcohol, I sleep better, focus more, and wake up with a sense of purpose instead of grogginess. I no longer trade long-term health and happiness for a fleeting buzz.
If you’re questioning whether alcohol is worth it, I encourage you to try living without it for a while. The difference is profound.

## Staying Motivated: Why Discipline Matters More

A friend recommended Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity by Peter Attia, MD. This book was a revelation. It made me see health in a new light.

First, everything we do today determines our health 20 years from now. Every issue we face today stems from decisions we made 20 years ago. That perspective is humbling.
Second, exercise is not just about losing weight or looking good — it’s about pushing physical and cognitive decline as far into the future as possible.

But here’s the thing: I still have bad days. Days when it all feels meaningless. Days when I slip and eat things I don’t need or want, or get less sleep than I should. But on those days, I try to be gentle with myself. I don’t punish myself — I learn, I adjust, and I move forward. Progress doesn’t come from perfection, but from persistence. As David Perlmutter says:

> “Strive for progress, not perfection.”

Hard work always pays off.

## Reversing Time

Today, my metabolic age is **36**.

I’ve turned back the clock by a full decade, and the feeling is indescribable. My cholesterol levels are now within healthy limits, and I plan to keep them there.

## My Deepest Gratitude

I want to extend my deepest thanks to Dr. Kristjan Pomm, my andrologist, and Dr. Kristel Ehala-Aleksejev, my nutrition therapist. Their guidance and support changed my life.
And above all, my deepest love and gratitude go to my wife, **Helin**. Her unwavering support and encouragement were the foundation of this transformation. I love you, honey.
