## How It All Started

I started working — meaning actually getting paid — when I was seven years old.  
Back then it wasn’t called *child labor* — it was just normal.

My father is a carpenter, and when I was small, I wanted to be exactly like him.  
He has this ability to know how to build everything, and I admired that — the ability to create something tangible, something real.

When I grew older, during the summer before high school, I discovered computers — these strange boxes with buttons and a screen.  
I didn’t have the faintest idea what to do with them, so I went to the local library, borrowed every book I could find about computer science, and read through all of them that summer. By autumn, I was hooked.  

That curiosity led me to study computer science — especially how it all *actually works*, applied physics and all — and eventually to work full-time as a software developer.  
Within a few years, I had become a project manager, then a product manager, running large teams and big products — all while studying full-time at university.

Everything seemed to go extremely well.  
Until it didn’t.

## The Wake-Up Call

One day, my body stopped cooperating.  
I was diagnosed with serious health issues. My doctor told me to *take things easy.*  
I had no idea what that meant. Slowing down felt like a complete failure.

That was the first time I learned that **quality doesn’t equal quantity.**  
It changed my life. I took a year off from university, reduced my workload, and tried to figure out what “taking it easy” actually meant.

## Lessons From the Army-Run Company

In 2004, I joined **Playtech** — back then a mysterious company in Tartu.  
It was run with military precision; everything was a mission. You accomplished it, or you went home.  

It taught me discipline and decisiveness.  
I learned that **making a quick decision is better than waiting** — even if it’s the wrong one. You can always adjust.  
But hesitation kills everything.

I spent 11 years there. My department grew from two people to 150.  
We went from spending money to generating nine figures in revenue.  
Yet, after a decade, I felt I needed to move on. The company was big, successful, and slow — and I was ready to make mistakes again.

So I left.

## Losing the Title, Finding Myself

The next morning, I woke up and realized I had no idea who I was anymore.  
For years, when people asked, “Who are you?” I would answer with my job title.  
Now there was no title left.

That emptiness turned out to be valuable.  
It forced me to separate **who I am** from **what I do.**

## Building, Crashing, and Learning My Limits

Soon after, I co-founded **Nevercode** with my friend Triin.  
I thought I knew everything — I had seen it all at Playtech.  
I was wrong.

We worked like maniacs, believing that long hours equaled success.  
We copied Silicon Valley’s mythology of 100-hour weeks.  
We didn’t sleep, didn’t eat properly, just built and built.

Then one night, driving home, I crashed my car. Completely destroyed — yet I walked away without a scratch.  
That night changed my life for the second time.  

I realized **I do have limits.**  
I started sleeping again. Every night.  
And I tell this to everyone — *if you didn’t sleep well today, go home and sleep. Everything starts from there.*

## The Power of Stopping

Eventually, Nevercode started struggling.  
Bigger, better-funded competitors surrounded us. We were exhausted and out of ideas.  
So we did something radical: **we stopped.**

We sat down and just listened.  
When you’re quiet, you start hearing small signals that others ignore.  
That silence led us in a direction no one else was noticing — and a year later, we signed a contract with **Google HQ in Mountain View.**

Slowing down saved the company.  
Listening saved it.

Later, at the right moment — when we were on top — we stepped away and handed the company to new leadership.  
It felt like letting your child walk away — painful, but the only right choice to make.  
Sometimes, moving forward means letting go.

## What Slowing Down Taught Me

Here’s what I’ve learned through all of this:

- Don’t rush. If you rush, you stop listening.  
- **Make the right product before you make the product right.**  
- **Remove everything that doesn’t matter.** Deleting is as important as adding.  
- **Keep direction.** Once you know where you’re going, stay on course.  
- **Have someone to battle with.** It’s more fun, and you’ll go further.  
- And most of all: **take time to listen.**

When you slow down, you start seeing what truly matters.  
You make better decisions, build stronger teams, and create products that last.

That’s what I mean when I say:  
**To build fast, you need to be slow.**
