Last week marked a significant milestone in my career — I wrapped up my final day at Dynatrace. It was just before the winter holidays, and as I took a moment to reflect on the year and my future, I realized how much has been achieved during my nearly three years with the company.

When I first joined, it was a small team working out of a room in Rotermanni Spaces HUB in Tallinn, focused on integrating and developing something that had the potential to make a big impact. Now, we’re in our own building, with 3000 square meters of office space, fully functioning teams, proper management structures, and our team is three times the size it was back then. We’ve built an incredible culture, and we’re one of the highest-rated employers in Tallinn. Of course, there’s still so much to do, and the plans ahead are nothing short of ambitious.

It would have been easy to continue riding the momentum of what we’ve built. But as I looked deeper, I realized something was missing. At first, I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Then it hit me — the excitement of building something great, the adventure and pace of creating something that hadn’t been done before, had started to feel like following a set plan and executing what had already been established. While this structure works for some, I’ve always thrived in the unknown — the mixture of diving into uncharted territory and taking risks. I need to be where I can once again build and make a difference.

And with that, I made the decision to say no to continuing in my current role. I made sure that my team has the best possible path forward without me, and I celebrated the completion of a journey that made the impossible possible.

A huge thank you to everyone at Dynatrace, especially my people in Tallinn Lab — Kati Päike, Raido Karro,Indrek Übius, Dmitri Maksimov, Maxim Pokrovskiy and the rest of the amazing team we have. I also know that without these people, it would have been impossible: Gordon Meyer, Samuel Moser, Elke Oberhuber, Chris Werding, Magdalena Nalepa,Tamás Antal and so many others, whose support made this journey so rewarding.

People have asked me countless times what’s next, and to be honest, I don’t know.

That’s where I’ll be focusing my energy for now, before diving into my next adventure.
