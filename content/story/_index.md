### Building and Leading at Scale ###

I am an engineering leader who builds and scales high-performing organizations in global product companies.

Over the past two decades, I have founded companies, led large engineering teams, and operated within complex international environments. I scaled **Playtech Mobile** from inception to **$120M in annual revenue**, co-founded **Nevercode**, a globally used developer platform, and built **Dynatrace Tallinn** into a high-impact engineering hub within a global observability organization.

My work sits at the intersection of technology, product, and organizational design. I focus on building strong leadership layers, creating clarity in complex systems, and aligning long-term technical direction with disciplined execution.

I care deeply about quality, resilience, and building systems that last — both in software and in teams.

I am open to select Director and VP opportunities in global product and platform organizations where engineering excellence and long-term thinking matter.
