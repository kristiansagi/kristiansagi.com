### From Founder to Leader — Now Ready to Lead at Scale ###

I’m a technology leader who builds organizations that deliver — with purpose, precision, and heart.

Over the past two decades, I’ve built and led high-impact teams across startups and global tech companies.
From scaling **Playtech Mobile** from an idea to **$120M in annual revenue**, to co-founding **Nevercode** and redefining developer tooling, to leading **Dynatrace Tallinn** into a world-class engineering hub — my path has always been about one thing: **turning vision into impact**.

I believe technology leadership is more than architecture and metrics.
It’s about creating systems where talented people can do their best work, where clarity turns into momentum, and where trust drives execution.

I’m now seeking my next opportunity — a leadership role where **engineering**, **innovation**, and **organizational clarity** can create lasting value.
I’m open to roles in **Estonia or internationally**, with relocation fully on the table for the right mission.
